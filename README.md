# Nunu Bot
Nunu is a smart voice over bot.
Whenever someone joins a voice call, Nunu would also like to join.

When the person that joined the call starts to talk, Nunu will play a pre-recorded audio sound. Once finalized, Nunu would like to leave the voice call.

Whenever someone else joins the call, Nunu would repeat the process.


> **Nunu is completely clustered**
Meaning that it shares load distribution across multiple child processes.
